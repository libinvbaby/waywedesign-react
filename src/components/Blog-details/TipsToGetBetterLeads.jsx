                        If you use Google, you are already using artificial intelligence (AI). Just think about all the things you use Google for: searching the internet, finding directions, looking up facts, checking the weather, etc. AI powers all of these tasks. However, how does it work?
<br />
AI is based on the idea of building machines that can learn and work on their own, without being explicitly programmed. This is possible because AI systems can identify patterns in data. For example, when you search for something on Google, the system looks through all the billions of web pages that exists and ranks them according to how relevant they are to your search query. Google’s AI system is quite complex and is constantly getting smarter. For example, the Google Translate feature uses AI to provide real-time translations to text and speech. Moreover, the new Google Duplex feature allows users to make phone calls using natural language processing.
<br />
As you can see, AI is already changing the way we live and work. Artificial intelligence has made major advances in the last few years, with an exponentially growing trendsetting power to come soon enough.
